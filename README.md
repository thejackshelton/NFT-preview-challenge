## My process

I began with making div's and adding all the HTML elements necessary. I then started adding CSS and customizing the necessary elements similar to the solution. This is my first ever coding project, so I spent a lot of time looking at commands and how to best implement them. I was unable to figure out how to add the view icon over the image when hovering over it, and I'd love to figure out how to implement it.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to use the position function, and refreshed my memory on the commands I learned from the course I was taking. I started learning CSS and HTML5 about a week and a half ago. I look forward to continue learning more!


### Continued development

I'm not comfortable enough with using CSS and HTML5, and I would like to increase the speed at which I write code and figure out solutions as well. I need to get better at flex box, grid, and overall positioning items at different areas faster.



### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - I used it for certain commands and syntax.
